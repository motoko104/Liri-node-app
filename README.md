# Liri Node App

_LIRI is a **L**anguage **I**nterpretation and **R**ecognition **I**interface that is used through the command line to take in paramaters and gives back data searched._

### Why Use Liri?
_Liri_ is a great little node app thats useful to search through 3 different API's all through the command line. The 3 different searches that can be done with Liri are:

* Spotify
*OMDB
*Bands in Town

### How to get started
**First and foremost** you will want to get your own API keys for the three API's used with these files and create your own _.env_ file to store your own API keys that can be used to access these API's and run this node app correctly.

**Note: your keys will not be in brackets when added to your _.env_ file**
